# Unit 3 Project: Twitter Client - Part 1

## Overview
Build a simple Twitter client that supports viewing a Twitter timeline.

### User Histories

User can sign in to Twitter using OAuth login

User can view the tweets from their home timeline

For each tweet, show the relevant information: the tweet body along with the author's username and name
 Creating the Timeline
 API Request and creating models
Sending Network Requests
 Showing the data with a RecyclerView
Using the RecyclerView

User can refresh tweets timeline by pulling down to refresh


### Stretch stories
User can view more tweets as they scroll with infinite pagination

Improve the user interface and theme the app to feel "twitter branded"

Links in tweets are clickable and will launch the web browser

### Notes
I faced some challenges working in the implementation of my account of Twitter getting linked with this app.

### Open-source libraries used

- [Android Async HTTP](https://github.com/codepath/CPAsyncHttpClient) - Simple asynchronous HTTP requests with JSON parsing
- [Glide](https://github.com/bumptech/glide) - Image loading and caching library for Androids
